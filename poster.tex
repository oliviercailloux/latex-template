			Scenario:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Assume a commitee wants to choose a voting rule
				\item Many rules
				\item No best rule
			\end{itemize}
			We want to:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \emph{automatically} explain the outcome of rules
					\item \emph{based} on their properties
					\item by referring to \emph{examples}
				\end{itemize}

			Let’s argue that in $\prof$, $a$ should win, using “unanimity”, “symmetry” and “reinforcement”
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tabularx}{0.9\colwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{4cm}X}
					System & Consider election $\prof_1$, involving only voter~$v_1$. Do you agree that $a$, enjoying unanimous support, should win this election? \\
					User & Yes, of course. \\
					System & Now consider election $\prof_2$, involving only voters $v_2$ and $v_3$. Do you agree that, for symmetry reasons, the outcome should be a three-way tie? \\
					User & Yes, that sounds reasonable. \\
					System & Observe that when we combine $\prof_1$ and $\prof_2$, we obtain our election of interest, namely $\prof$. Do you agree that in this combined election, as there was a three-way tie in $\prof_2$, $\prof_1$ should be used to decide the winner? \\
					User & Yes, I do. \\
					System & To summarise, you agree that $a$ should win for~$\prof$.
